# What is SQL Syntax

Just like every other programming language has their syntax, SQL does too.

SQL syntax is a unique set of rules and guidelines to be followed while writing SQL statements.

## We will be looking at some of the Syntax in SQL

#### - Case Sentsitivity

The most important point to be noted here is that SQL is case **Insensitive**, which in simple terms means **SELECT** is the same as **select**.

**NOTE:** I will write all SQL keywords in upper-case

#### - Semicolon after SQL Statements?

Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.<br>
Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.
<br>

**NOTE:** I will use semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.

**Example:**
<br>

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```
