# SQL Mastery

Welcome to the SQL Mastery directory! ðŸŽ‰

In this directory, I focus on mastering SQL (Structured Query Language), a powerful and essential tool for managing and manipulating relational databases. From querying data to designing database schemas, this is where I hone my skills in SQL to become proficient in database management.

## About SQL

SQL is the standard language used to communicate with relational databases. Whether it's retrieving data, inserting records, updating tables, or performing complex joins and aggregations, SQL provides a robust and efficient way to interact with structured data. By mastering SQL, I can effectively manage and manipulate databases to extract valuable insights and drive informed decision-making.

## SQL Topics Covered
