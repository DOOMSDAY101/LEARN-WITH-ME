# SQL Mastery

Welcome to the SQL Mastery directory! ðŸŽ‰

In this directory, I focus on mastering SQL (Structured Query Language), a powerful and essential tool for managing and manipulating relational databases. From querying data to designing database schemas, this is where I hone my skills in SQL to become proficient in database management.

## About SQL

SQL is the standard language used to communicate with relational databases. Whether it's retrieving data, inserting records, updating tables, or performing complex joins and aggregations, SQL provides a robust and efficient way to interact with structured data. By mastering SQL, I can effectively manage and manipulate databases to extract valuable insights and drive informed decision-making.

## Learning Objectives

- **Querying Data**: Learn how to write SQL queries to retrieve, filter, and sort data from databases.
- **Database Design**: Understand the principles of database design, including normalization, relationships, and indexing.
- **Data Manipulation**: Explore SQL commands for inserting, updating, and deleting records in tables.
- **Advanced SQL**: Dive into advanced SQL topics such as joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, and stored procedures.
- **Performance Optimization**: Learn techniques for optimizing SQL queries and improving database performance.
- **PRACTICE**: Practice what I have learnt so far 

## Practice with Node.js

**Please note**, I'll be using Node.js as the primary programming language/Framework for practicing SQL queries and interacting with databases programmatically.
